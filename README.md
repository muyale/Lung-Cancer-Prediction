In this project I use deep learning to predict whether or not a patient will have lung  cancer.

Lung cancer is a cancer that begins in the lungs and most often occurs in people who smoke.
Two major types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Causes of lung cancer include smoking, second-hand smoke, exposure to certain toxins and family history.

# Symptoms

.Chest pain 
.Wheezing 
.Weight loss
.A new cough that doesn't go away
.Coughing up blood, even a small amount
.Shortness of breath
.Hoarseness
.Losing weight without trying
.Bone pain
.Headache


Lung cancer begins in the lungs and may spread to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. Cancer from other organs also may spread to the lungs. When cancer cells spread from one organ to another, they are called metastases.Lung cancers usually are grouped into two main types called small cell and non-small cell. both these types of lung cancer grow differently and are treated differently.

For this project I use some of these symptoms such as fatigue,chronic pain,wheezing and fit them together in my model. 

# Stages of Lung Cancer

There are a total of 5 Stages of cancer :


Stage 0: The  tumor is very small. Cancer cells haven’t spread into your deeper lung tissues or outside your lungs.

Stage I (“stage 1”): Cancer is in the  lung tissues but not your lymph nodes.

Stage II (“stage 2”): The disease may have spread to the lymph nodes near the  lungs.

Stage III (“stage 3”): It has spread further into the lymph nodes and the middle of the chest.

Stage IV (“stage 4”): Cancer has spread widely around your body. It may have spread to your brain, bones, or liver.
